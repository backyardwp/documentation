## Server requirements

**PHP 7.3** or higher is required in order to run Backyard.

<hr/>

## Install Composer

The framework uses Composer to manage its dependencies. Please follow [the documentation](https://getcomposer.org/) on the official website in order to install it.

> We recommend installing Composer globally on your system.

## Install the framework

Navigate to the folder where you wish to create a WordPress plugin and through your terminal run the following command:

```bash
composer require backyardwp/framework
```

This will install the framework and the dependencies.
